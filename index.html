<p>This repo was imported from <a href="https://bitbucket.org/boredzo/prhonoffbutton/overview">here</a> at first ( it was hosted on Bitbucket, but I love GitHub rather than the former ).
Its original writer is <a href="https://bitbucket.org/boredzo">Peter Hosey</a>, thank you for this awesome framework! And I will continue to develop it.</p>

<h3>
<a name="purpose" class="anchor" href="#purpose"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Purpose</h3>

<p>This is a button cell class that aims to replicate the sliding-switch button, as seen in many iPhone apps and in the Time Machine pane in System Preferences.</p>

<h3>
<a name="compatibility" class="anchor" href="#compatibility"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Compatibility</h3>

<p>This class works on the Mac (using AppKit). It will not work on the iPhone, where there is no reason for it (it already has a sliding-switch class).
The implementation requires Mac OS X 10.5 or later, primarily for NSGradient.</p>

<h3>
<a name="getting-started" class="anchor" href="#getting-started"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting started</h3>

<p>Add PRHOnOffButton.[hm] and PRHOnOffButtonCell.[hm] to your source code directory, your Xcode project, and the relevant targets.
In IB, add a checkbox to your xib.
Select it. Switch to the Identity (<code>⌘⌥3</code> in Xcode 5.x and later) Inspector. Set the control's class to PRHOnOffButton.
Double-click the control to edit its cell. Set the cell's class to PRHOnOffButtonCell.</p>

<h3>
<a name="features" class="anchor" href="#features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>The cell supports the mixed state. You can turn that on in the Attributes (<code>⌘⌥4</code> in Xcode 5.x and later) Inspector for your button control. (You probably shouldn't set it for the cell specifically unless it's hosted in a matrix or something instead of a button control.)</li>
<li>Since it's a cell, it should work in matrixes and table views, although I haven't tested it in a table view.</li>
</ul>
