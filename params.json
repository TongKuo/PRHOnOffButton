And I will continue to develop it.\r\n\r\n### Purpose\r\nThis is a button cell class that aims to replicate the sliding-switch button, as seen in many iPhone apps and in the Time Machine pane in System Preferences.\r\n\r\n### Compatibility\r\nThis class works on the Mac (using AppKit). It will not work on the iPhone, where there is no reason for it (it already has a sliding-switch class).\r\nThe implementation requires Mac OS X 10.5 or later, primarily for NSGradient.\r\n\r\n### Getting started\r\nAdd PRHOnOffButton.[hm] and PRHOnOffButtonCell.[hm] to your source code directory, your Xcode project, and the relevant targets.\r\nIn IB, add a checkbox to your xib.\r\nSelect it. Switch to the Identity (`⌘⌥3` in Xcode 5.x and later) Inspector. Set the control's class to PRHOnOffButton.\r\nDouble-click the control to edit its cell. Set the cell's class to PRHOnOffButtonCell.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* The cell supports the mixed state. You can turn that on in the Attributes (`⌘⌥4` in Xcode 5.x and later) Inspector for your button control. (You probably shouldn't set it for the cell specifically unless it's hosted in a matrix or something instead of a button control.)\r\n* Since it's a cell, it should work in matrixes and table views, although I haven't tested it in a table view.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
